# Backend-Assignment
Backend Assignment-1

** Idea used :
-----------------

I have made simple modification in dijkstra algorithm. The arrival array holds the arriving time on that vertex. Unlike naive dijkstra the departure time of a node will not always be the same as arrival time. Instead to find the departure time we find the next available free time from the given set of unsafe slots of the node.


** Execution :
--------------------
In Windows:

> g++ code.cpp

> a.exe

In Linux:

> g++ code.cpp

> .\a.out
